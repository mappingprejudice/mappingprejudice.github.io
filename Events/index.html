                  "This research is showing what communities of color have known for decades. Structural barriers stopped many people who were not White from buying property and building wealth for most of the last century… Contemporary White residents of Minneapolis like to think their city never had formal segregation. But racial covenants did the work of Jim Crow in northern cities like Minneapolis." – Mapping Prejudice</br></br>

                  Through extensive historical research and analysis, Mapping Prejudice has helped to unearth the shameful history of racial covenants and redlining in Minneapolis dating back more than 100 years.</br></br>

                  And there is still much work to be done.</br></br>

                  <b>Bring your laptop and your friends out to Hennepin History Museum on Thursday, June 13th</b>, as we continue the work of Mapping Prejudice by documenting the history of discriminatory deeds and furthering our work towards creating a more just Minneapolis.</br></br>

                  Mapping Prejudice is a team of activists and scholars who show how the contemporary geography of Minneapolis has been shaped by historic restrictions on property ownership. Using digital technology, they are assembling the first-ever map of racial covenants for an American city. Discover the hidden history of race in Minneapolis and learn how you can contribute to the research behind the Mapping Prejudice project. <br><br>

                  Part presentation, part hands-on workshop, you may bring your laptop (or use ours) to learn how to read historic deeds and identify racial covenants for the online map.

                  Join us at the Linden Hills Park Building for a screening and discussion of the TPT documentary, "Jim Crow of the North."<br><br>
                  Why does Minnesota suffer some of the worst racial disparities in the nation?<br><br>
                  One answer is the spread of racist, restrictive real estate covenants in the early 20th century. Jim Crow of the North is based on the work of the University of MN’s research project, Mapping Prejudice.<br><br>
                  The panel will include Daniel Pierce Bergin, Jim Crow of the North Producer, and Kirsten Delegard, Mapping Prejudice Project Director. Community members are invited to join the discussion.<br><br>

                  <b>A traveling exhibit, "Displaced", will be on display prior to the screening, at 6:00p.m. and the documentary screening will begin at 6:30p.m.</b><br><br>

                On May 2nd, The Sabathani Community is hosting an opening event for the exhibit in its new home and will also be raising funds for the center.<br><br>

                The Sabathani Community Center provides essential social services to the southside area of Minneapolis including a food shelf, clothing closet, job training, and tax preparation services. All proceeds from this event will go towards supporting Sabathani in providing resources for the community.<br><br>

                Make sure to get your tickets and join us for a fun night of entertainment, performances, and a silent auction. Check back here for more upcoming information!<br><br>

                Owning Up: Racism and Housing in Minneapolis explores the history of racial housing discrimination in Minneapolis through the stories of three black families. The exhibit demonstrates the lasting effects of structural discrimination and aims to counter the enduring idea of Minneapolis as a model metropolis.<br><br>

                Why does Minnesota have some of the worst racial disparities in the nation? To understand our contemporary inequities, we need to look to the history of racist, restrictive real estate covenants. A new documentary from Twin Cities PBS tells this story. Jim Crow of the North is based on the work of the Mapping Prejudice Project at the University of Minnesota. This cutting-edge research is documenting, mapping and presenting data on restrictive covenants in the largest metro area in the upper Midwest. The story charts the progression of racist policies and practices from the advent of covenants at the beginning of the twentieth century to the late 1960s. The Twin Cities never had Southern style segregation. But as this work shows, racial covenants were just one aspect of the Jim Crow system of the North.

               Join us for a panel discussion and community conversation about the lifecycle of redlining, disinvestment, predatory lending, and gentrification and displacement — a damaging cycle that runs on racial prejudice and the unregulated flow of extractive capital out of and into communities — and the set of critical interventions from government, communities and businesses that are necessary at each stage of this destructive cycle. This event will lift up the need for community-owned, deeply rooted financial institutions, businesses and housing; for government protections and incentives to make sure that productive, non-extractive services, goods and housing are available to low and moderate income residents during times of disinvestment, and protections for those residents so they are able to remain, thrive and reap the benefits of the influx of capital; and the need for community based advocacy and organizing to hold businesses and investors accountable to make investments that benefit the existing community, rather than profiting from their anticipated and engineered displacement.

               West of Central is set in the Watts neighborhood of Low Angeles, in the aftermath of the urban unrest that roiled more than 150 American cities. The plot turns on the racist housing practices that created the highly segregated--and ultimately explosive--landscape of American cities in the 1960s. After the performance, Mapping Prejudice co-founder, Kirsten Delegard. will be on hand to talk about covenants, redlining and white violence created the racial disparities that we have today in Minneapolis. We look forward to talking with the audience about the connections between the past and the present. In dialogue, we are looking to explore how an awareness of history can help us build a more equitable future.<br><br>

             <br>Many residents of Minneapolis believe that their city has never had any kind of formal segregation. This tour makes visible the structural racism that has undergirded the city’s urban landscape. It also illuminates the community solidarity that developed among African Americans in the face of this white hostility.</p>

              <p class="model-events-text">The way our neighborhoods look and feel today are a product of our shared history; one shaped by racist policies that barred households of color from homeownership and wealth accumulation for many years. In spite of these intentional barriers, like redlining and racial covenants, communities of color created and continue to build vibrant neighborhoods, rich with gathering places and family legacies that are often lost to the general public — and policy makers who make decisions that impact our lives everyday. Join us for the first gathering of the “Racism, Rent and Real Estate: Fair Housing Reframed” event series to learn more about the history and impetus of fair housing laws and share your knowledge about the history of your family and neighborhood.
